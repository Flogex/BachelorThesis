# A comparison of Introspected REST with alternative approaches to the development of web APIs with regards to performance, evolvability, and complexity

This is my German bachelor's thesis at HTWK Leipzig.
Original title: _Vergleich von Introspected REST mit alternativen Ansätzen für die Entwicklung von Web-APIs hinsichtlich Performance, Evolvierbarkeit und Komplexität_

I wrote the English summary as part of an application for a master's degree programme. 

## Abstract

Introspected REST is a new approach to the development of web APIs. It builds upon the REST architectural style. In this thesis, Introspected REST is compared to REST,
GraphQL, and gRPC in terms of performance, evolvability, and complexity/usability. The results show that the performance of Introspected REST is in the same order of
magnitude as the performance of REST. Both are in turn outperformed by gRPC and GraphQL, respectively. The evolvability rates similarly to REST’s evolvability, too.
Using Introspected REST for an API does most notably improve its usability.
